	solutionstudio/util/repo/repo.py, solutionstudio/util/sync/cache.py:
	added support for sha256

	Previously we used the Python 2.4 builtin sha and md5 modules to
	perform checksum operations. The builtin sha module did not provide
	support for the sha256 algorithm, however. This becomes an issue
	with EL6 package repositories which use sha256 sums for validating
	repodata files. Python 2.5 introduces support for sha256 using a new
	builtin hashlib module. This module has been made available for use
	with previous python versions (2.3 and 2.4) via a separate module,
	packaged as python-hashlib and made available from the EPEl 5
	package repository.

	This commit adds support for sha256 checksums using the hashlib
	module. Specific changes include:

	* added dependency on python-hashlib to rpm specfile
	* removed imports for sha and md5 modules; added imports for hashlib
	* consolidated separate 'md5sum' and 'shasum' pps functions to a
	single 'checksum' function, and added a new parameter for indicating
	'type' (e.g. md5, sha1, sha256)
	* modified calling functions in various solution studio modules to use
	the new checksum function and pass the type parameter.

	added 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux' entry to yum_plugin locals file
