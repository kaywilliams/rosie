===============


Requirements
============

The following packages are needed for Spin to run:

* ImageMagick
* anaconda-runtime
* createrepo
* python
* python-devel
* python-imaging
* python-lxml
* python-setuptools
* rendition-common
* rpm-build
* syslinux
* yum


Installation
============

*Currently, there are no spin and rendition-common RPMs available, so*
*you cannot install Spin. Read, the README file for information*
*regarding running Spin from its sources.*

YUM
---

Create a .repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d/ that contains the following

::

        [spin-repo]
        name = spin-repo
        baseurl = http://repo/containing/spin/and/dependencies
        enabled = 1


Then type the following at the command line

::

        $$ yum install spin


RPM
---

Download the RPM from http://path/to/spin/rpm and save it at a
convenient location. Also, download all the RPMs required by
Spin. Then at the command line, type the following

::

        $$ rpm -i ImageMagick-<version>-<release>.<arch>.rpm
        ... (install other dependencies)
        $$ rpm -i spin-<version>-<release>.<arch>.rpm
