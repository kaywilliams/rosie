Installing Spin
===============

This document covers Spin requirements, installation, and getting started.

Requirements
============

The following packages are needed for Spin to run:

* ImageMagick
* anaconda-runtime
* createrepo
* netpbm-progs
* python
* python-devel
* python-imaging
* python-lxml
* python-setuptools
* rendition-common
* rpm-build
* syslinux
* yum

Note: Some of the packages (e.g. python-lxml) can be found in the Extra Packages
for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) or Fedora Everything RPM repositories.


Installation
============

Spin RPMs will be coming soon.  In the meantime, this document describes how you
can obtain Spin and run it directly from source code.


In the following instructions, we assume that the working directory is
``SPIN_RUN``.

1. Clone **Spin** source code repositories
------------------------------------------

::

  $$ cd $SPIN_RUN
  $$ hg clone https://www.renditionsoftware.com/hg/public/spin
  $$ hg clone https://www.renditionsoftware.com/hg/public/rendition-common


In your ``~/.bashrc`` file, add the following line

::

  export PYTHONPATH=$SPIN_RUN/rendition-common:$SPIN_RUN/spin:$PYTHONPATH


and then at the command line

::

  $$ source ~/.bashrc


2. Create the Spin configuration file
-------------------------------------

Create a file called ``/etc/spin.conf`` and add the following lines:

::

  <spin>
    <share-path>$SPIN_RUN/spin/share/spin</share-path>
  </spin>

Alternatively, you can copy ``$SPIN_RUN/spin/share/doc/examples/spin.conf`` 
to the /etc folder as a starting point and modify the share-path.

3. Install Spin dependencies
----------------------------

Install packages listed above under `Requirements`. Note that yum must be run
as the root user.

::

  $$ yum install (dependencies listed above)  


Getting Started
===============

1. Create a Distribution Definition File (.distro)
--------------------------------------------------

Spin includes some example files to help you get started. Copy these files to
a new folder, called ``DISTRO_DIR`` below.  While you are experimenting, you 
will most likely want DISTRO_DIR to be in your home folder. Later you will want
to maintain your .distro and related files using a Source Code Management 
system such as CVS, SVN, git, or the like.

::

  $$ mkdir $DISTRO_DIR
  $$ cp $SPIN_RUN/share/doc/example/repos $DISTRO_DIR
  $$ cp $SPIN_RUN/share/doc/example/example.distro $DISTRO_DIR
  $$ cd $DISTRO_DIR


Now you can open and modify the repos and example.distro files. 

The repos file contains URLs to common package repository mirror locations. 
For best performance, open this file and modify the macro elements to point to 
local package mirrors.

::

  <!-- Change the macros below to point to local mirrors -->

  <macro id="centos">http://mirror.centos.org/centos-5</macro>
  <macro id="epel">http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel</macro>
  <macro id="fedora">http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux</macro>
 

The example.distro file describes details of your distribution, including name, 
version, packages to include, package repositories to use, etc. As an experiment, 
modify this file to create a distribution based on CentOS 5 x86_64 by setting 
the main and repos sections of the file to contain the following:

::

  <main>
    <fullname>Example</fullname>
    <product>example</product>
    <version>c5</version>
    <arch>x86_64</arch>
  </main>

  <repos>
    <xi:include href="repos" xpointer="xpointer(/distro/repos[@id='c5-x86_64']/*)"/>
  </repos>


2. Running Spin
---------------

To run Spin, type the following at the command line. Note that Spin must be run
as the root system user; this is required because Spin mounts and modifies
installation images.

::

        $SPIN_RUN/bin/spin $DISTRO_DIR/example.distro


3. Using the Custom Distribution
--------------------------------

Your new custom Linux distribution can be found at ``/var/www/html/distros``.  
Enjoy!
