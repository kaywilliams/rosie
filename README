Running Spin From Sources
=========================

To run Spin from sources, make sure you have all its dependencies
installed. For more information regarding Spin's dependencies, read
the INSTALL file.

For this example, we will assume that the working directory is
SPIN_RUN.

1. Clone **spin** repository
----------------------------

::

        $$ cd $SPIN_RUN
        $$ hg clone https://www.renditionsoftware.com/hg/public/spin
        $$ hg clone https://www.renditionsoftware.com/hg/public/rendition-common


In your ~/.bashrc file, add the following line

::

        export PYTHONPATH=$SPIN_RUN/rendition-common:$PYTHONPATH


and then at the command line

::

        source ~/.bashrc


2. Creating the Spin configuration file
---------------------------------------

Create a file called **/etc/spin.conf** and add the following lines to
it

::

        <spin>
                <library-path>$SPIN_RUN/spin</library-path>
                <share-path>$SPIN_RUN/spin/share/spin</share-path>
        </spin>


3. Creating the Distribution definition file
--------------------------------------------

3.1 Scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are a company's system administrator, and the company has been
changing all its desktops to Fedora 9. A typical employee of the
company needs a computer that lets him surf the internet. He doesn't
care about how he gets to a browser as long as he knows about it and
gets to use the internet. You know that every so often, you will be
called to fix this employee's computer, so you need a fast way to get
to the terminal and type away at the command prompt to figure out, and
hopefully fix, the problem.

3.2 Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You do some research and read Fedora 9's comps.xml and find out that
the following groups and packages satisfy your needs.

3.2.1 Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^
base, base-x, core, graphical-internet, gnome-desktop

3.2.2 Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
nautilus-open-terminal

3.3 Putting things together
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are now ready to put together your custom distribution's
definition file.

The easiest way to accomplish this is to copy distribution definition
file's from $SPIN_RUN/share/doc/examples/fedora9.distro and save it
somewhere else. Let's call this file DISTRO_FILE. Now, open
DISTRO_FILE.

*Aside*. The Spin Distribution Definition file, allows you to use
XIncludes and XPaths as you would in regular XML files.

Add a ``<comps>`` element as a child of the ``<distro>`` element and
add the following to it

::


        <group>base</group>
        <group>base-x</group>
        <group>core</group>
        <group>graphical-internet</group>
        <group>gnome-desktop</group>
        <package>nautilus-open-terminal</package>

::

        $SPIN_RUN/bin/spin custom.distro


5. Use Custom Distribution
