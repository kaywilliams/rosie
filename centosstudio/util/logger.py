A module for convenient yet powerful file, console, and syslog logging

BASIC USAGE

  from logger import Logger

  log = Logger(threshold=0)    # create the log object and give it
                               # a threshold of 0
  log.log(2, 'all done')       # send a log of priority 2 (not printed)
  log(0, 'error: bandits!')    # send a log of priority 0 (printed)
  log.write(0, stringvar)      # do a raw write on the file object

DESCRIPTION

  Each logging object is given a threshold.  Any messages that are
  then sent to that object are logged only if their priority meets or
  exceeds the threshold.  Lower numerical priority means that a
  message is more important.  For example: if a log object has
  threshold 2, then all messages of priority 2, 1, 0, -1, etc will be
  logged, while those of priority 3, 4, etc. will not.  I suggest the
  following scale:

     LOG PRIORITY    MEANING
              -1     failure - cannot be ignored
               0     important message - printed in default mode
               1     informational message - printed with -v
               2     debugging information

        THRESHOLD    MEANING
              -1     quiet mode (-q) only failures are printed
               0     normal operation
               1     verbose mode (-v)
               2     debug mode (-vv or -d)

  It can be extended farther in both directions, but that is rarely
  useful.  It can also be shifted in either direction.  This might be
  useful if you want to supply the threshold directly on the command
  line but have trouble passing in negative numbers.  In that case,
  add 1 to all thresholds and priorities listed above.

CLASSES

  There are three primary classes defined in this module:

    Logger        Class for basic file and console logging
    SysLogger     Class for syslog logging
    LogContainer  Class for wrapping multiple other loggers together
                  for convenient use

  Instances of all of these support the same basic methods:

    obj.log(priority, message)   # log a message with smart formatting
    obj.write(priority, message) # log a string in a ver raw way
    obj(priority, message)       # shorthand for obj.log(...)

  Different classes support other methods as well, but this is what you
  will mostly use.


ADVANCED

  There are a number of options available for these classes.  These are
  documented below in the respective classes and methods.  Here is a
  list of some of the things you can do:

    * make a prefix contain a string which gets repeated for more
      important logs.  (prefix)
    * directly test if a log object WOULD log, so you can do
      complicated stuff, like efficient for loops. (test)
    * make the priority, threshold arbitrary objects, with a
      home-rolled test to see if it should log. (test)
    * give log containers a "master threshold" and define arbitrary
      behavior based on it.  Examples include:
      - only pass on messages of sufficient priority (ragardless of
        the thresholds of the log ojects).
      - only pass on messages to objects whose thresholds are
        (numerically) lower than the master threshold.

SEE ALSO

  Take a look at the examples at the end of this file in the test &
  demo section.

    BASIC OPTIONS:

      There are a couple of basic options that are commonly needed.
      These are attribues of instances of class Logger.

        preprefix

          Text that will be printed at the start of each line of
          output (for log()ged, not write()en messages).  This might
          be your program's name, for example.

            log.preprefix = 'myprog'

          If preprefix is callable, then it will be called for each
          log and the returned value will be used.  This is useful for
          printing the current time.

            import time
            def printtime():
                return time.strftime('%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S ',
                         time.localtime(time.time()))
            log.preprefix = printtime

        file_object

          This is the file object to which output is directed.  If it
          is None, then the logs are quietly dropped.

      There are other options described in the next section, but these
      are the most commonly used.

class SysLogger:
    """A class for file-object logging

    USAGE:
      For the most part, SysLogger instances are used just like Logger
      instances.  Notable exceptions:

        * prefixes aren't used (at least not as they are for Logger)
        * map_priority is pretty important because it controls
          conversion between Logger priorities and syslog priorities
        * although priority/threshold/test works the same, there is
          also maskpri and your syslog config which will limit what
          gets logged.  Keep this in mind if you see strange behavior.

      The most sensible use of this class will be will a LogContainer.
      You can create one Logger instance for writing to (say) stderr,
      a second for writing to a verbose log file, and a SysLogger
      instance for writing important things to syslog so your automated
      log-readers can see them.  Then you put them all in a log container
      for convenient access.  That would go something like this:

        from logger import Logger, SysLogger, LogContainer

        fo = open(file_log, 'w')
        file_logger    = Logger(4, file_object=fo) # print 4 and lower
        console_logger = Logger(1)                 # print 1 and lower
        syslog_logger  = SysLogger(0)              # print 0 and lower
        log = LogContainer([file_logger, console_logger, syslog_logger])

        log(3,  'some debugging message') # printed to file only
        log(1,  'some warning message')   # printed to file and console
        log(0,  'some error message')     # printed to all (ERR level)
        log(-1, 'major problem')          # printed to all (CRIT level)

class LogContainer:
    """A class for consolidating calls to multiple sub-objects

    SUMMARY:
      If you want a program to log to multiple destinations, it might
      be convenient to use log containers.  A log container is an
      object which can hold several sub-log-objects (including other
      log containers).  When you log to a log container it passes the
      message on (with optional tests) to each of the log objects it
      contains.

    USAGE:

      The basic usage is very simple.  LogContainer's simply pass on
      logs to the contained Logger, SysLogger, or LogContainer
      objects.

        from logger import Logger, LogContainer

        log_1 = Logger(threshold=1, file_object=sys.stdout)
        log_2 = Logger(threshold=2, preprefix='LOG2')

        log = LogContainer([log_1, log_2])

        log(1, 'message')               # printed by log_1 and log_2
        log(2, 'message')               # only printed by log_2

      A more common example would be something like this:

        from logger import Logger, LogContainer

        system = Logger(threshold=1, file_object=logfile)
        debug  = Logger(threshold=5, file_object=sys.stdout)
        log = LogContainer([system, debug])

        log(3, 'sent to system and debug, but only debug will print it')
        log(0, 'very important, both will print it')

      In this mode, log containers are just shorthand for calling all
      contained objects with the same priority and message.

      When a log object is held in a container, it can still be used
      directly.  For example, you can still do

        debug(3, ['this will not be sent to the system log, even if its',
                  ' threshold is set very high'])

      (Yes, you can send lists of strings and they will be formatted
      on different lines.  The log methods are pretty smart.)

      There are more examples in the SysLogger docs.
