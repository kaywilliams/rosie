  <emphasis>@content</emphasis>: Accepts either "file" or "text".  When
  <emphasis>content</emphasis> is "file", the element's text value is treated
  as a <varname>PATH</varname> to a file, whereas when it is "text", the
  element's text value is interpreted as the raw text to use for creating a
  file. The default value is "file".

  <para>
  The Deploy installation includes a number of templates to assist with
  common definition creation tasks. These templates are located in the folder
  at <filename>/usr/share/deploy/templates/</filename>. The templates are
  not discussed in detail here, however, many are referenced in the relevant
  sections throughout the remainder of this document.
  </para>

  <para>
  Users can customize individual files by copying to a new templates folder
  that follows the hierarchy of the original. To make Deploy aware of the new
  folder, add it as a <emphasis role='strong'>templates-path</emphasis> in the
  Deploy Configuration File (<filename>/etc/deploy/deploy.conf</filename>).
  Deploy searches template folders in the order specified. See the deploy.conf
  man page (<command>man deploy.conf</command>) for additional information on
  the <emphasis role='strong'>templates-path</emphasis> element.
  </para>

  <warning>
  <para>
  Do not modify files in the
  <filename>/usr/share/deploy/templates</filename> folder. Changes to
  these files will be overwritten when updated versions of the Deploy
  RPM are installed.
