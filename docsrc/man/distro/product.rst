<product-image>
---------------


The product-image element allows the user to specify one or more files to be
included in the product.img generated by spin.  Files are added by listing
them in path elements; if a destination aside from the root of the image is desired,
this can be accomplished by using the path's 'dest' attribute.


::

	element product.img {
	  element path { ... }*
	}
