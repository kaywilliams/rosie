  <title>Choosing a Use Case: A Samba Server</title>

  <para>For the purpose of this user guide, examples, processes and
  illustrations will focus on defining, building, deploying and updating a
  <application class="software">Samba</application> server based on
  <application class="software">CentOS 5</application>. Samba is a project of
  the <ulink url="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom
  Conservancy</ulink>. Samba is a key interoperability component in a blended
  operating system environment. When installed on a Linux or Unix operating system, it enables that system
  to act like a Windows file or print server, enabling Windows users to print
  to or save files using it.</para>

  <para>The discussions and code examples in this chapter and subsequent parts
  focus on a Samba server based on CentOS 5 that enables print and file
  services. In this chapter, the examples assume the server will be
  installed via the network directly from the build machine. The SDFR provides
  the syntax for all parent and child elements and their attributes.</para>

  <para>Creating the <application class="software">Samba</application>
  server system distribution entails several process steps. After configuring
  the <application class="software">SystemStudio</application> build machine,
  as described in the previous chapter, you need to create a system distribution
  system definition 
  (<filename class="extension">samba-server.definition</filename>). Then
  you run <command>systemstudio</command> to validate the file, retrieve
  the packages and build the system distribution. From there you prepare the boot
  media.</para>

  <para>The next section will explain how to define the system
  before you build it and prepare for deployment to a client
  system.</para>
