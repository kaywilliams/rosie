  <title>Building a Distribution</title>

  <para>Now that you have defined your distribution, use the
  <command>systembuilder</command> command to build it.</para>

  <note>The initial build of a distribution can be time consuming, on the order
  of several minutes to an hour or more. Initial build time depends on a number
  of variables including the location of package repositories (local or remote), 
  network connection speed, the number of packages included in the distribution, 
  and the amount of content that can be reused from the SystemBuilder shared 
  cache. Subsequent builds complete in much less time, often 1-2 minutes, 
  depending on the level and type of change since the previous build.</note>

  <para>The basic <command>systembuilder</command> command validates the 
  distribution definition syntax, creates the distribution, and records 
  process results. The default level of screen output includes errors, build
  and module status and file download and creation status. SystemBuilder also
  sends this output to the log file, by default 
  <filename>/var/log/systembuilder.log</filename>. If a critical error
  occurs, SystemBuilder includes detailed error information in the log file.
  To run your build, enter the command below:</para>

  <para><informalexample>
      <programlisting>#systembuilder samba-server.distribution</programlisting>
    </informalexample>The output for an initial run details all the steps
  for downloading packages, checking package dependencies and creating
  images. If there are any errors, <application
  class="software">SystemBuilder</application> notes those and, in many cases,
  halts the process. See Appendix A for an example of a successful first-build
  output.</para>
