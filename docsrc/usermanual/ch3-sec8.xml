  <title>Tying it All Together</title>

  <para>In summary, there are several steps to creating a successful
  distribution.</para>

  <para>First, you configure the <application
  class="software">SolutionStudio</application> build machine to accommodate the
  size and number of distributions you will build and store concurrently. The 
  system should be accessible through your local network.
  After configuring the hardware, you can install one of the <application
  class="software">Linux </application>operating system versions on which <application
  class="software">SolutionStudio</application> runs.</para>

  <para>Then you define your distribution in the <filename
  class="extension">samba-server.definition</filename> file using XML tags
  defined in the DDFR. Your definition includes several key pieces of
  information:</para>

  <para><itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>the name of the distribution, its version and architecture;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the repositories for the operating system and application packages, including
        base install and update mirror locations;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the package groups and packages to include and any packages to 
        exclude; and</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>system configuration files and scripts.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist></para>

  <para>Once the distribution definition is complete, you log on as the root user
  and execute the command <userinput>solutionstudio samba-server.definition</userinput>
  to build the distribution. Output goes to the screen and the default log file.
  The first build may take some time, since <application
  class="software">SolutionStudio</application> needs to do everything from 
  scratch:</para>

  <para><itemizedlist>
      <listitem>file:///usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html
        <para>validate the <filename
        class="extension">samba-server.definition</filename> file,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>locate input repositories,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>create the configuration package,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>resolve package dependencies,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>download packages from input repositories,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>create the distribution repository (and it's metadata),</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>create network installation images, and</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>copy, or <emphasis>publish</emphasis>, distribution content to a web-accessible location.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>Deploying client machines requires two steps. First, you 
  create the CD or DVD boot media. And then you install the client machine by
  inserting the disk into the client machine and later verifying that the 
  contents are correct. Alternatively, you can use virt-manager or virt-install
  to deploy new virtual machines based on the distribution.</para>

  <para>Updating your distribution can involve simply checking for mirror 
  repository updates. Or it can involve changing the distribution definition or
  configuration files and scripts. Depending upon the changes it encounters, 
  <application class="software">SolutionStudio</application> will 
  update the distribution as necessary. After updating the
  distribution, you will need to run <userinput>yum sync</userinput> on client
  machines to keep them up to date with the current distribution.</para>

  <para>In the Samba CentOS 5 Server example presented here, what you have
  in the end is a distribution for a Samba server on CentOS 5 for the i386
  architecture. Your <filename>smb.conf</filename> file provides custom <application
  class="software">Samba</application> configuration instructions. The
  packages come from the repositories at <ulink
  url="http://mirror.centos.org">http://mirror.centos.org</ulink> .</para>

  <para>Now that you have your definition, you can prepare it for use in a
  production environment. The next chapter explains this process.</para>
