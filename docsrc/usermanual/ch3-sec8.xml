  <title>Tying it All Together</title>

  <para>In summary, there are several steps to creating a successful
  solution.</para>

  <para>First, you configure the <application
  class="software">CentOS Studio</application> build machine to accommodate the
  size and number of solutions you will build and store concurrently.
  The system should be accessible through your local network.
  After configuring the hardware, you can install one of the <application
  class="software">Linux </application>operating system versions on which 
  <application class="software">CentOS Studio</application> runs.</para>

  <para>Then you define your solution in the <filename
  class="extension">samba-server.definition</filename> file using XML tags
  defined in the SDFR. Your definition includes several key pieces of
  information:</para>

  <para><itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>the name of the solution, its version and architecture;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the repositories for the operating system and application packages, including
        base install and update mirror locations;</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the package groups and packages to include and any packages to 
        exclude; and</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>system configuration files and scripts.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist></para>

  <para>Once the solution definition is complete, you log on as the root user
  and execute the command <userinput>centosstudio samba-server.definition</userinput>
  to build the solution. Output goes to the screen and the default log file.
  The first build may take some time, since <application
  class="software">CentOS Studio</application> needs to do everything from 
  scratch:</para>

  <para><itemizedlist>
      <listitem>file:///usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html
        <para>validate the <filename
        class="extension">samba-server.definition</filename> file,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>locate input repositories,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>create the configuration package,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>resolve package dependencies,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>download packages from input repositories,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>create the solution (and it's metadata),</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>create network installation images, and</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>copy, or <emphasis>publish</emphasis>, solution content to a web-accessible location.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>Deploying client machines requires two steps. First, you 
  create the CD or DVD boot media. And then you install the client machine by
  inserting the disk into the client machine and later verifying that the 
  contents are correct. Alternatively, you can use virt-manager or virt-install
  to deploy new virtual machines based on the solution.</para>

  <para>Updating your solution can involve simply checking for mirror 
  repository updates. Or it can involve changing the solution definition or
  configuration files and scripts. Depending upon the changes it encounters, 
  <application class="software">CentOS Studio</application> will 
  update the solution as necessary. After updating the
  solution, you will need to run <userinput>yum sync</userinput> on client
  machines to keep them up to date with the current solution.</para>

  <para>In the Samba CentOS 5 Server example presented here, what you have
  in the end is a solution for a Samba server on CentOS 5 for the i386
  architecture. Your <filename>smb.conf</filename> file provides custom <application
  class="software">Samba</application> configuration instructions. The
  packages come from the repositories at <ulink
  url="http://mirror.centos.org">http://mirror.centos.org</ulink> .</para>

  <para>Now that you have your definition, you can prepare it for use in a
  production environment. The next chapter explains this process.</para>
