  <title>Production Systems</title>

  <para>You can harness <application class="software">SystemStudio</application>'s
  architecture and features to create a production system development
  environment with reusable components for the system distribution definition,
  version tracking for that and other configuration files, expedited testing
  procedures and alternate development and production locations. Using <application
  class="software">SystemStudio</application> as part of a long-term deployment and
  shop management strategy will enable you to be more efficient and provide an
  system development and deployment history that is repeatable and
  predictable.</para>

  <para>In this chapter, you will set up a production process for creating, 
  testing, deploying and updating your Samba server. You will divide your 
  <filename>samba-server.definition</filename> file into reusable components. 
  You'll also choose appropriate download and storage locations. Then you'll log
  those files into the versioning system of your choice. The testing process
  for your distribution definition has several options, which are covered in
  the last section.</para>
