  <title>Doing More with SystemBuilder</title>

  <para>Now that you have created your basic
  <filename>samba-server.definition</filename>, you can customize your
  system through additional elements in the system distribution definition. When
  selecting packages, you may want certain events to occur depending upon what
  package version is installed or deinstalled. Scripts that run automatically
  or are triggered upon certain installation or deinstallation events give you
  more power over the sequence of events and combination of packages. You can
  also automate system installation by including a kickstart file. SystemBuilder
  also accomodates your preferences for media and kernel boot arguments. If your
  company's legal department or custom software development department
  requires certain content, you can include those components, as well.</para>

  <para>Updating your system distribution is easy with SystemBuilder, but you need to
  understand whether the client machine or just the system distribution repository or
  both will include any updates. The next chapter addresses that critical issue.
