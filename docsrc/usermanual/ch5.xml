  <title>Doing More with SystemStudio</title>

  <para>Now that you have created your basic
  <filename>samba-server.definition</filename>, you can customize your
  system through additional elements in the system distribution definition. When
  selecting packages, you may want certain events to occur depending upon what
  package version is installed or deinstalled. Scripts that run automatically
  or are triggered upon certain installation or deinstallation events give you
  more power over the sequence of events and combination of packages. You can
  also automate system installation by including a kickstart file. SystemStudio
  also accomodates your preferences for media and kernel boot arguments.</para>
