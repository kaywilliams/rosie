  <title>Replicated Clients/Scale-Out</title>

  <para>
  CentOS Studio also supports replicated client and scale-out deployments. In
  this scenario, many client machines share duplicate software and
  configuration. For these environments, traditional client installation, which
  can take 5-10 minutes per client, is inefficent.  Instead, it is preferable
  to make a single machine image which can be applied to client hard drives
  using an efficient low-level disk copy process.

  <para>
  CentOS Studio supports this scenario in the same manner as the <xref
  linkend='virtual'/> scenario. In particular, you will start with a repository
  definition similar to that shown in the <xref linkend='smb'/> scenario. To
  that definition you will add a <emphasis>publish/script</emphasis> element
  with a <emphasis>@type</emphasis> attribute of 'install' and a
  <emphasis>@ssh</emphasis> attribute of 'false'. The script will first create
  the machine image. Then it either copy the image to a location where it can
  be used in the production deployment process, or more likely, send an email
  notification that a new image is available. The latter case allows greater
  control over changes in the production environment. The details of the script
  will vary based on requirements of the production deployment system.
