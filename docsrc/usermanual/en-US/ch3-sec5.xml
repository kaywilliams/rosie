  <title>Building a System Repository</title>

  <para>
  Now that you have defined your repository, you use the
  <command>deploy</command> command to build it. Running Deploy
  validates the definition syntax, creates the repository, and logs
  process results. The default level of screen output includes errors, build
  status and file download and creation status. Deploy also sends this
  output to the log file, by default
  <filename>/var/log/deploy.log</filename>. If a critical error occurs,
  Deploy includes detailed error information in the log file.
  </para>

  <para>
  The initial build of a repository can be time consuming, on the order of 2-10
  minutes or more, depending on the location of package repositories (local or
  remote), network connection speed, the number of packages included in the
  repository, and the amount of content that can be reused from the Deploy
  shared cache.  Subsequent builds complete in much less time, often less than
  a minute, depending on the level and type of change since the previous build.
  </para>

  <para>To build the web-server repository we have been defining, enter the
  command below:</para> 

  <para><informalexample>
      <programlisting>#deploy web-server.definition</programlisting>
    </informalexample></para>

  <para>The output for an initial run details all the steps
  for downloading packages, checking package dependencies and creating
  images. If there are any errors, <application
  class="software">Deploy</application> notes those and, in many cases,
  halts the process.</para>

  <para>
  When the process is complete, you can locate your new repository at
  <filename>/var/www/html/deploy/systems/web-server-6-i386</filename>.
  </para>
  
  <para>
  You will also notice that Deploy has created a new <xref
  linkend='data-file'/>,
  <filename>web-server-6-i386.dat</filename>, in the same location as you
  definition. Take care not to delete this file as it contains
  important information for your system.
  </para>

  <title>Using command-line macros </title>

  <para>
  Because we were careful to make use of macros while creating the definition,
  the same definition can be used for multiple operating system versions and
  architectures. To provide the desired version and arch when executing Deploy, use the <constant>--macro</constant> command line option. The example
  below shows using command line macros to specify both os and arch.
  </para>

  <para><informalexample>
      <programlisting>#deploy --macro "os:rhel" --macro "arch:x86_64" web-server.definition</programlisting>
    </informalexample></para>
