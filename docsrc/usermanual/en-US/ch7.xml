  <title>Package Repositories</title>

  <para>
  Package repositories are typically created and maintained by Independent
  Software Vendors (ISVs) who distribute consumer and enterprise applications,
  and by systems administrators, who manage applications and configuration
  across multiple clients within an organization. Package repositories are
  useful for deploying software and configuration that is applicable across
  multiple clients, and that does not change from client to client.

  <para>
  In this chapter we will discuss defining, creating and using package
  repositories.
