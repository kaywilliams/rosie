  <title>Choosing a Use Case: A Samba Server</title>

  <para>For the purpose of this user guide, examples, processes and
  illustrations will focus on defining, building, deploying and updating a
  <application class="software">Samba</application> server based on
  <application class="software">CentOS 5</application>. Samba is a project of
  the <ulink url="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom
  Conservancy</ulink>. Samba is a key interoperability component in a blended
  OS environment. When installed on a Linux or Unix OS, it enables that system
  to act like a Windows file or print server, enabling Windows users to print
  to or save files using it.</para>

  <para>The discussions and code examples in this chapter and subsequent parts
  focus on a Samba server based on CentOS 5 that enables print and file
  services. In this chapter, the examples assume the server will be
  installed via the network with a web server and that the download server is
  the <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build system.
  The SDFR provides the syntax for all parent and child elements and their
  attributes.</para>

        <para>Creating the <application class="software">Samba</application>
        server distribution entails several process steps. After configuring the
        <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build system,
        you need to create system definition file
        (<filename class="extension">samber-server.xml</filename>). Then
        you run <command>systembuilder</command> to validate the file, retrieve
        the packages and build the distribution. From there you prepare the boot
        media.</para>

    </mediaobject>The drawing above illustrates three of the five steps
  necessary to complete the <application class="software">Samba</application>
  server distribution. The next section will explain how to define the system
  before you build it and prepare for deployment to a client
  system.</para>
