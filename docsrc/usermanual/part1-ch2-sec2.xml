  <title>Choosing an Appliance Use Case: A Samba Server</title>

  <para>For the purpose of this user guide, examples, processes and
  illustrations will focus on defining, building, deploying and updating a
  <application class="software">Samba</application> server appliance based on
  <application class="software">CentOS 5</application>. Samba is a project of
  the <ulink url="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom
  Conservancy</ulink>. Samba is a key interoperability component in a blended
  OS environment. When installed on a Linux or Unix OS, it enables that system
  to act like a Windows file or print server, enabling Windows users to print
  to or save files using it.</para>

  <para>The discussions and code examples in this chapter and subsequent parts
  focus on a Samba server based on CentOS 5 that enables print and file
  services. In this chapter, the examples assume the appliance will be
  installed via the network with a web server and that the download server is
  the <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build system. The SDFR
  provides the syntax for all parent and child elements and their
  attributes.</para>

        <para>Creating the <application class="software">Samba</application>
        appliance entails several process steps. After configuring the
        <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build system, you
        need to define the appliance using the appliance definition file
        (<filename class="extension">samba-server.appliance</filename>). Then
        you run <command>systembuilder</command> to validate the file, retrieve the
        packages and build the appliance RPMs. From there you prepare the boot
        media.</para>

    </mediaobject>The drawing above illustrates three of the five steps
  necessary to complete the <application class="software">Samba</application>
  server appliance. The next section will explain how to define your appliance
  before you build it and prepare for deploying the appliance to a client
  system.</para>
