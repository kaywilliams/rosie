  <title>Building Your Appliance</title>

  <para>Now that you have defined your appliance, use the
  <command>systembuilder</command> command to build it. The build process sends output
  to the screen and to a log file.</para>

    <title>Executing the <command>systembuilder</command> command</title>

    <para>The basic <command>systembuilder</command> command validates the <filename
    class="extension">.appliance</filename> file syntax, resolves package
    dependencies, creates appliance-specific packages, creates an appliance
    package repository, and creates deployment images, all while recording
    process results. The default level of screen output includes errors, build
    and module status and file download and creation status. SystemBuilder also sends
    this output to <filename>/var/log/systembuilder.log</filename>. If a critical error
    occurs, SystemBuilder includes that information in the log file. To run your sample
    appliance file, enter the command below:</para>

    <para><informalexample>
        <programlisting>#systembuilder samber-server.xml</programlisting>
      </informalexample>The output for an initial run details all the steps
    for downloading packages, checking package dependencies and creating
    images. If there are any errors, <application
    class="software">SystemBuilder</application> notes those and, in many cases, halts
    the process. See Appendix A for an example of a successful first-build
    output.</para>
