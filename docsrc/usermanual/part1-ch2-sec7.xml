  <title>Updating a Client Machine</title>

  <para>If there are changes to the distribution, you will
  need to update installed client machines using <command>yum</command>
  <option>sync</option>. For this example build, log on to the client machine 
  as the root user and execute the <userinput>yum sync</userinput> command. </para>

  <para>Using the <command>yum </command><option>sync</option> command, 
  provided by the <xref linkend="sync-plugin"/>,
  will update all packages on the client machine from the distribution
  repository, including the system-specific <xref linkend="configuration-package"/>
  created during the build process.</para>

  <para>To see what packages changed on the client machine, check the
  <filename>yum.log</filename> file in the <filename
  class="directory">/var/log/</filename> directory.</para>

  <para>For the samba-server example, you should see that a new version of the samba-server-config package is installed, the prior version of the samba-server-config package is removed, and a number packages from the admin-tools group, including system-config-network and system-config-users, are removed. You can verify that the <filename>smb.conf</filename> has been updated by typing <command>cat /etc/samba/smb.conf</command> at the command line and ensuring the workgroup is now set to "MYCOMPANY" rather than "WORKGROUP".</para>
