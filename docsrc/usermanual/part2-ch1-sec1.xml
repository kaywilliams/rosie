  <title>Life Cycle Management Use Case: a Samba Server</title>

  <para>To set up a more robust process for creating, testing, deploying and
  updating your Samba server installation on CentOS 5 using your
  <filename>samber-server.xml</filename> file, you'll do several tasks in
  this section. First, you'll divide the file into reusable components. You'll
  also choose appropriate download and storage locations. Then you'll log
  those files into the versioning system of your choice. The testing process
  for your distribution definition file has several options, which are covered in
  the last section.</para>
