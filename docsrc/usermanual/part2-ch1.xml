  architecture and features to create a production software development
  environment with reusable components for the distribution definition file,
  version tracking for that and other configuration files, expedited testing
  procedures and alternate publish and download locations. Using <application
  class="software">SystemBuilder</application> as part of a long-term deployment and
  shop management strategy will enable you to be more efficient and provide an
