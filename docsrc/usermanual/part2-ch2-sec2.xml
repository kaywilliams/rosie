  <title>Versioning Definitions</title>

  <para>To track and audit any changes to the <application
  class="software">SystemBuilder</application> files that are critical to the
  definition, configuration and scripts of a system, use a revision
  control system, such as <application
  class="software">Subversion</application>, <application
  class="software">Git</application> or <application arch=""
  class="software">Mercurial</application>. The Red Hat-based Linux OS' that
  SystemBuilder works with by default (<application
  class="software">RHEL</application> and <application
  class="software">CentOS</application>) have the revision control system
  <application class="software">Subversion</application>
  (<command>svn</command>) available by default.</para>

  <para>While everything could be revision controlled, there are some key
  non-image files that should be. Within the <application
  class="software">SystemBuilder</application> infrastructure and distribution
  building process, candidates for revision control include configuration files,
  distribution definition files and scripts, i.e. files that contain critical
  textual information that may change over time or are commonly used to define
  aspects of multiple system distributions, such as common repositories or network
  configuration.</para>

  <para><itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>distribution definition files,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><filename>systembuilder.conf</filename>,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>system configuration files,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>system configuration scripts, and</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>distribution definition XInclude files.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist></para>

  <para>If you decide to not use a revision control system, you could rename
  the distribution definition file or other key
  files every time you make a change to help you "version" your distribution.
  You can also enter comments in the files. Keep in mind that changing the name
  of distribution definition file does not mean <application class="software">
  SystemBuilder</application> will build a new distribution.
  As long as the <varname>$DISTRIBUTIONID</varname> remains the same, the
  distribution remains the same.</para>
