  <title>Choosing a Distribution's Storage and Download Locations</title>

  <para>By default <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> uses the
  <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build system as the default
  locatin for publication and remote access. See the section "Deploying Client Machines"
  under Part I, Chapter 2, and the DDFR for more information about
  the default settings. When the default settings are not appropriate, use the
  <emphasis>publish</emphasis> TLE in the distribution definition to direct
  <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> where to store 
  the distribution and what URL to use to make it accessible to clients for
  download.</para>

  <para>Essentially, you have one choice for the server location of the
  published system distribution, the <application class="software">
  SystemBuilder</application>build system. However, you can choose different
  directories on that machine. If the <filename class="directory">/var
  </filename> directory is on a separate logical drive, increasing the drive
  capacity is easier. </para>

  <para>For the network-accessible location of the system distribution for
  download, you have two choices: somewhere on the <application
  class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build system or on another server.
  Choosing that location depends upon several factors: your network security
  topography, the location of your client systems, the types and number of
  distributions, the number of users accessing the distribution and the number
  of types of OSes used in the distributions.</para>

  <para>SystemBuilder can accommodate a number of scenarios for storage and download.
  Critical considerations include whether you have a single LAN versus a
  separate DMZ, a download machine with multiple active interfaces, multiple
  active ports or secure login requirements. SystemBuilder handles all of these through
  the distribution definition file, e.g.
  <filename>samber-server.xml</filename>.</para>

        <term><emphasis role="strong">Scenario 1: Alternate publish, or
        storage, locations</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>While the publish and storage location is on the <application
          class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build system, the default
          location of <filename
          class="directory">/var/www/html/distributions/<varname>$DISTRIBUTIONID</varname></filename>
          may not meet your needs. For administrative purposes, you may wish
          to keep separate paths for different distributions or types of
          distributions or make only certain paths accessible to others for
          download from the <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application>
          build system. To accomplish this, use
          <emphasis>publish/local-dir</emphasis> to set an alternate directory
          for publication. The default download URL will be the IP address of
          the SystemBuilder build system's first active, non-loopback network
          interface.</para>

        <term><emphasis role="strong">Scenario 2: Single LAN but multiple
        machines with one external firewall</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>In this scenario, you may want to have separate physical
          machines for build management and security administration purposes.
          Use <emphasis>publish/remote-url</emphasis> to specify the full URL
          path to the remotely accessible directory.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis role="strong">Scenario 3: Separate DMZ for secure
        remote accessibility</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>A separate DMZ most likely means the <application
          class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build system is behind your
          external firewall for security purposes. The question is whether you
          want the remotely accessible download host to be there, too, or in
          the DMZ. To assign the distribution to a download server in the DMZ,
          use <emphasis>publish/remote-url</emphasis> with the full http path
          and machine's IP address.</para>

        <term><emphasis role="strong">Scenario 4: Multiple active
        interfaces</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>While <application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> does
          not factor in multiple active interfaces on the <application
          class="software">SystemBuilder</application> build machine, it does consider
          them for the remotely accessible server. By default it chooses the
          first active, non-loopback network interface. To specify another
          interface, enter the network card's number, e.g. "eth2," in the
          <emphasis>publish/remote-url@interface</emphasis> attribute.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis role="strong">Scenario 5: Multiple
        ports</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para>To obscure and control the network communications, you can use
          a unique port number, e.g. 8080, in the
          <emphasis>publish/remote-url</emphasis> path.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><emphasis role="strong">Scenario 6: Secure
        login</emphasis></term>

        <listitem>
          <para><application class="software">SystemBuilder</application> allows you to
          specify a user login name and password for download purposes using
          <emphasis>publish/remote-url</emphasis>. The login and password are
          free text.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>For the remotely accessible URL for the download server,
  you can use either a hostname or an IP address. One key advantage to using a
  machine's hostname is the ease of access using single name for multiple IPs,
  either separately or together as a multihoned machine. Domain naming makes
  the download server more logically accessible as opposed to IP addresses.
  Finally, a hostname does not expose your IP blocks and network
  topology.</para>
