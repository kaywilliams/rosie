  <title>Doing More with Spin</title>

  <para>Now that you have created your basic
  <filename>samba-server.appliance</filename>, you can customize your
  appliance through additional elements in the appliance definition file. When
  selecting packages, you may want certain events to occur depending upon what
  package version is installed or deinstalled. Scripts that run automatically
  or are triggered upon certain installation or deinstallation events give you
  more power over the sequence of events and combination of packages. You can
  also automate your appliance by including a kickstart file. Spin also
  accomodates your preferences for media and kernel boot arguments. If your
  company's legal department or custom software development department
  requires certain content, you can include those components, as well.</para>

  <para>Updating your appliance is easy with Spin, but you need to understand
  whether the client system or just the appliance repository or both will
  include any updates. The next chapter addresses that critical issue.</para>
