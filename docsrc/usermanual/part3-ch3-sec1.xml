  <title>Automating Your Appliance Installation</title>

  <para>Spin can save you time and labor by helping you automate the boot-up
  and appliance kickstart process.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Kickstarting your appliance</title>

    <para>Kickstart installations automate the install process of a RedHat OS
    and make the installations reproducible. You may want to use this method
    if you have large-scale installations, complex storage requirements,
    multiple network interfaces, secure systems or site-specific strategies.
    Within the Spin process, the kickstart file automates the installation and
    manages several functions during the install: selection of language,
    network configuration, distribution source, keyboard, filesystem, mouse,
    timezone, root password and package handling.</para>

    <para>Instead of managing multiple kickstart files, Spin lets you make it
    part of the appliance definition. By revision controlling the Spin files
    (see Part 2), the kickstart process can be controlled, too.</para>

    <para>Use the <emphasis>kickstart</emphasis> TLE in the
    <filename>samba-server.appliance</filename> file to identify one kickstart
    file, as in the example below. Substitute your own kickstart filename for
    <filename>ks.cfg</filename>.</para>

    <para><informalexample>
        <programlisting>&lt;kickstart&gt;ks.cfg&lt;/kickstart&gt;</programlisting>
      </informalexample></para>

    <para>See the ADFR for the <emphasis>kickstart</emphasis> TLE
    syntax.</para>
