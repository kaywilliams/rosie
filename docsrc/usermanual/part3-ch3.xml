  <title>Booting up Your Appliance</title>

  <para>By default Spin creates installable images for your appliance. But you
  may already have a process in place that utilizes your own application
  kickstart files. Or you may prefer to use other media or kernel arguments
  during the boot process. Spin empowers you to reuse some of what you have
  already developed.</para>
