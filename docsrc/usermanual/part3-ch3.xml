  <title>Booting client machines</title>

  <para>By default SystemBuilder creates boot mages to use during system
  installation. But you may already have a process in place that utilizes your
  own kickstart files. Or you may prefer to use other media or kernel arguments
  during the boot process. SystemBuilder empowers you to reuse some of what you have
  already developed.</para>
