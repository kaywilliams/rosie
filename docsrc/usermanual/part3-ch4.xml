  <title>Preparing Your Distribution for Release</title>

  <para>Following the basic instructions in Part I, you can release your
  distribution with the default settings. Typically, larger organizations may
  have business and security constraints that they wish you to follow. The
  legal department may require a EULA or other legal statements. If your
  distribution includes custom software developed in-house, then the software
  development team may require help files and release notes, as well as files
  for release.</para>
